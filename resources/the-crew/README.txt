The Crew Unlimited (TCU) was made by a team (not linked to me). All credit goes to them !
- Their official website: https://thecrewunlimited.com
- Their patreon: https://www.patreon.com/tcuproject

Some manual instructions : 
1) The TCULauncher should launch, if not follow the instructions to install the ".NET Desktop Runtime"
2) Click on the "+ button" (bottom left) to add a new installation, then select "TheCrew.exe" in the same folder
3) Click on the "patch button" (top right), then yes, then ok

4) Optional - if you dumped your savegame when servers was still online (with "TCSaveDumper")
You can restore it with the "Import UBI Save" button (select the file .json, then choose a name for the save)
The name you choose will also be your player name, ingame. You can change the name later again in TCULauncher.

5) Click on "Play"

6) For subsequent launches, you'll have to run TCULauncher.exe (you can add a shortcut on your desktop, add it to Steam as Non Steam game... whatever !)

7) Troubleshoot - if your antivirus goes crazy when you tries to launch the game, that's because TCULauncher uses DLL Injection to emulate the server.
You need to add your "The Crew" folder in exclusions. My installer has an option to do it with Windows Defender, but not for the others antivirus.
So if it's your case, you'll have to do it manually.

Have fun,
And thanks you again to the TCU Team <3
